<a id="about-me"></a>
Hi! I’m an incoming Master’s student in Computer Science at [Duke CS](https://cs.duke.edu/) starting fall 2025. My interest lies in deep neural networks, particularly convolutional and transformer-based architectures, as well as State-Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and Mamba.

I am best reached by email at [ajayvikramp@gmail.com](mailto:ajayvikramp@gmail.com).
